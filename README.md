AndroidApp
==========
This application is still in its very raw form and was created during my Summer 2014 break along with my partner Mohit Bharaney. 

This app asks the user for their current mood and then recommends what movie they can watch based on their mood. The motive of this app is in no way to act therapeutically if the user selects a negative mood option. 

This application has no back end of its own and fetches the data directly from the TMDB API. 

Languages used: Java, JSON, XML
Environment: Eclipse
